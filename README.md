# Data and Recruitment Insights Dashboard (Group Project)

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analytics solution designed to support recruitment and admissions decision-making.

The project was built **from scratch**, starting with primary data collection and ending with an interactive Power BI dashboard supported by insights and recommendations.

The analysis is based on **original survey data** collected using a custom-designed Google Form.

## End-to-End Project Scope (Built From Scratch)
This project followed the complete data analytics lifecycle:
1. Survey design and data collection  
2. Data extraction and preparation  
3. Data analysis and KPI development  
4. Insight generation and recommendations  
5. Dashboard development and presentation

## Data Collection (Primary Data)
- Designed a Google Form survey to collect recruitment-related data  
- Distributed the survey link to respondents to gather real-world responses  
- Captured data including:
  - Gender  
  - Age range  
  - Course level  
  - Course interest  
  - Tuition payment preference  
  - Loan requirement  
  - Online learning experience  

This ensured the dataset was **original and purpose-built**, rather than pre-cleaned or downloaded.

---

## Data Extraction & Preparation
- Exported Google Form responses into Excel (CSV format)  
- Cleaned and standardised the dataset:
  - Checked for missing and inconsistent values  
  - Normalised categorical responses (Yes/No, age groups, gender)  
  - Structured the data to support analysis and reporting  

---

## Data Analysis & KPIs
Using Excel and Power BI:
- Created pivot tables to analyse respondent behaviour  
- Developed key performance indicators (KPIs), including:
  - Total Respondents  
  - Interested in Course (Yes)  
  - Pay Full Tuition (Yes)  
  - Need Loan (Yes)  
- Analysed demographic and financial trends by:
  - Gender  
  - Age range  
  - Course interest  
  - Payment preferences  

---

## Dashboard Development
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:
  - KPI cards  
  - Comparative bar charts  
  - Slicers for gender, age range, and course level  
- Designed the dashboard for **non-technical stakeholders**, focusing on clarity, usability, and insight-driven storytelling  

---

## Insights & Recommendations
- Identified that a significant proportion of interested learners require financial support  
- Highlighted demographic differences in course interest and payment capability  
- Provided recruitment-focused insights to:
  - Improve outreach and targeting strategies  
  - Support funding and loan planning  
  - Optimise course offerings  

Business insights and recommendations were documented separately to support strategic decision-making.
